# Webscraping
This was a project done in python for my CS150 class which collects information from a wikipedia page, then analyzes it

I build a class called "WikiPage" that stores information about individual wikipedia pages (e.g. "Raising_of_Chicago") and use that class to build both a directory of pages (a dict of WikiPage instances) and an index by the page name (eg. "Raising_of_Chicago") to make queries and display charts of how pages are connected.
